Description
-----
- In blackjack, the card 'A' can be counted as either 1 or 11, providing flexibility to the player.
- The cards 'J' (Jack), 'Q' (Queen), and 'K' (King) all have a value of 10.
- If a player's total card value exceeds 21, they lose the game.
- The game begins with the first card dealt to the player, followed by the second card dealt to the dealer. The third card goes to the player, and the fourth card is reserved for the dealer but is not shown to the players.
- In the event that the player and dealer both have an equal number of points, the game ends in a draw, and neither wins.
- If the dealer's hand has a total value of less than 17, they are required to draw another card, making it their third card in the hand.
