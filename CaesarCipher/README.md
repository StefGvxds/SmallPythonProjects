The Caesar Cipher is a classic encryption technique that involves shifting each letter of the alphabet by a fixed number of positions. 
In this Python program, you can choose to either encode or decode a message. After selecting your action, input your message and the 
shift value. The program handles the encryption/decryption and displays the result.
