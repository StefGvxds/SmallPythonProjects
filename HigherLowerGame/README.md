Welcome to 'Higher or Lower - Celebrity Edition'! In this fun and engaging game, 
your goal is to compare the popularity of two celebrities and guess who has more 
followers on a popular social media platform.

You'll be presented with two celebrities, along with their names, descriptions, 
and home countries. Your mission is to decide who you think has a higher number 
of followers. Type 'A' if you think Celebrity A has more followers, or 'B' if 
you believe Celebrity B is more popular.

Your score will increase with each correct guess, and you'll find out how well 
you know the celebrity world. But beware, one wrong guess, and it's game over!

Can you reach the top of the leaderboard and prove your celebrity knowledge? 
Let's find out! Start the game and test your skills.
