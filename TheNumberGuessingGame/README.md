This program is a simple number guessing game with the following features:

1. The user selects a difficulty level: "easy" (10 attempts) or "hard" (5 attempts).
2. A random number between 1 and 100 is generated.
3. The user makes guesses, and the program provides feedback (too low, too high, or correct).
4. If the user guesses correctly within the allowed attempts, they win; otherwise, they lose.
5. The user can choose to play again or exit the game.
